### Description
A Web App Store, a open source project for you explore and learn (help me too with that, if you want of course).<br>
This project is 90% writed with Java code, It has an Rest API wich manages all the user, applications in database, orders and other entities. <br>
 A second version I did of this application uses a `JavaFX` application as the 'root' user, but i'll discontinuate that because i dont now how access data in a static way from a `JPA` repository whitout do thousents of `SQL` code lines.
